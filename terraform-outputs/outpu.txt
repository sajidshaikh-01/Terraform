Terraform outputs allow you to display useful information after your infrastructure has been created.
They are usually used for:

Showing important values (IP addresses, URLs, ARNs)

Passing values to other Terraform modules

Providing data for automation pipelines (CI/CD)

Outputs are defined in an outputs.tf file.
